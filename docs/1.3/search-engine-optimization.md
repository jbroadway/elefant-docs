# Search Engine Optimization

Elefant was built with many years of experience building SEO-compatible websites. That doesn't mean your site will automatically be completely optimized, but you have a good basis and tools that work with instead of against you.

## SEO means helping search engines find your pages

Elefant implements many built-in dynamic navigation tools, including a site map and breadcrumb that can be used to help them spider and not miss any page of your site.

You can also have as many landing pages as you can create which *aren't* in the default navigation but exist to draw people in on long-tail searches.

## SEO means controlling URLs, and link and page titles

Elefant follows best-practices on URL naming conventions (separating keywords with dashes, using keyword-based instead of parameter-based page fetching) and gives you complete control over the URL of each page.

Elefant also allows you to set the browser window `<title>` and navigation title separate from the title that appears in the `<h1>` of the page.

## Elefant supports social media too

Elefant provides built-in buttons for social media sites, including Facebook like and share, Twitter follow and tweet, and Google +1 buttons. It also uses Facebook or [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) for blog post comments, as well as RSS and notifying over a dozen blog indexing services.

The bottom line is that you have complete control with Elefant over your pages and your site structure, which is the key to being able to implement an effective SEO strategy for your website. From there, it's up to you to find your target keywords, plan your inbound link and social media strategies, write your blog posts, etc.
