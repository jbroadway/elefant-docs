# Edit Buttons

Elefant's main editing interface is your website itself. When you're logged in, you'll see the Elefant admin toolbar across the top, and edit buttons wherever there's content that you can edit.

This approach proves very intuitive to new users, because you simply browse your website to find the page you want to edit.

Once you're on the page you want to edit, you can click on the edit button that appears at the top of the page body. This is how the edit buttons will appear on your page:

The buttons, from left to right, are:

* **Add Page** - Add a new page to your site
* **Edit Page** - Edit the current page
* **Versions** - View the edit history for the current page
* **Delete Page** - Delete the current page

## Content blocks

You may also see edit buttons on sidebars and other areas of the page. These areas are called content blocks (or just, blocks). Content blocks also have the following edit buttons:

* **Edit Block** - Edit the content block
* **Versions** - View the edit history for the content block
* **Delete Block** - Delete the content block

Next, let's look at [[:content blocks]] in detail.
