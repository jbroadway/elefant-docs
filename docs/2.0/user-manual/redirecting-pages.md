# Redirecting Pages

You can create a page redirect within your site with the following steps:

1. Create a new page as you normally would.
2. Under Dynamic Objects, choose "Pages: Redirect Link"
3. Enter the address to redirect to, either a full site address or an internal link such as `/blog`. You can also choose whether the redirect is temporary or permanent, for SEO purposes.
4. Save the page.

When you visit the page as a site admin, instead of being redirected you'll see the following notice:

~~~
This page forwards visitors to the following link:

http://www.example.com/
~~~

This way, as an admin, you can still edit the redirecting page should you need to at any time, for example to update the redirection.
