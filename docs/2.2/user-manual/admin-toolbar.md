# Admin Toolbar

The admin toolbar will appear overlaid across the top of your website when you are logged in as an admin. The toolbar has three components:

## 1. The Elefant logo on the left

You can click the logo any time to be taken to the homepage of your site.

## 2. The Elefant admin links

While viewing your website:

* **Preview** - A link to preview the current page with the toolbar and edit buttons hidden
* **Tools** - A list of admin tools available on your site
* **Your username** - A link to your user profile
* **Log out** - A link to log out of the Elefant admin

While viewing any admin page:

* **Website** - Preview is replaced with a link to the last page you visited on your site

## 3. Upgrade notice

An upgrade notice will display in the middle of the toolbar if updates are available for your site.

> Note: Some sites may have this feature disabled.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Elefant has a number of shortcuts to make navigating your admin area faster for power users.
Here is a screenshot of the shortcut list that's displayed when you press `Ctrl + Shift + h`:

This list is context-dependent, so some options may not be available on all screens, and
some apps may add their own shortcuts as well.
