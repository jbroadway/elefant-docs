# Uploading files

Elefant includes a powerful file manager, including a multi-file drag and drop uploader, under Tools > Files.

From here, you can create folders and upload any type of file, as well as rename, download, or delete files. To reorganize files, simply drag and drop them onto folders to move them around.

You can then link to files through the [[:WYSIWYG Editor]], or even upload them directly via the WYSIWYG editor's file chooser dialog window.

MP3 files will be shown as an embedded audio player, and MP4 files will be shown as an embedded video player. SWF files will show as embedded flash, and common image types (JPG, GIF, and PNG) will embed themselves into the page as well. Other file types will simply appear as links to download the file.
