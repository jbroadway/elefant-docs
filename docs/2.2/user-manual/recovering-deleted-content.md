# Recovering deleted content

To recover a deleted page (or blog post, etc.), go to Tools > Versions in the Elefant admin toolbar.

By default, Versions shows a list of pages, but you can choose from other types of content in the `Type` drop-down menu.

From here you'll see a list of items (e.g., pages) in reverse chronological order. Find the item you want to restore and click `Show versions` in the right-most column.

This will bring you to a list of versions of the item, each of which you can click to `Compare to current` or in the case of the current version, you can click `View current` to view it.

In the comparison screen, there will be a link under the left-most version to `Restore` it. Click that to finish recovering the deleted item.
