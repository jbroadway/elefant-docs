## Contributing code

To hack on Elefant, please [create a fork of the repository](http://github.com/jbroadway/elefant), create a feature branch, and make your changes there.

If you are working on a feature or bug listed in our [Github issues](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/issues?_=1336681340159&state=open), please add a comment on the issue to let others know you've ""claimed"" it like this:

	Working on this in [https://github.com/username/elefant/tree/branchname]

The link should point to the branch in your fork on Github.

Once you have changes to be included in the main repo, create a pull request so we can track and review the changes before committing.

[Here's a great tutorial on the GitHub development process.](http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/)

### Branching policy

Elefant's branching scheme works as follows:

* `master` - This is the main development branch that new features are pulled into, but should always be relatively stable since new features are implemented in their own branches.
* `a.b` - Each minor release gets a new branch (e.g., `1.0`) so that updates can be made for it as needed.
* `feature-x` - Separate branch for ""feature x"", to be merged into `master` when complete.

Releases are tagged on the branch they were made, using the naming convention `elefant_a_b_c_status` e.g., `elefant_1_1_2_beta`.

### Version numbers

Elefant uses three-digit version numbers of the form `a.b.c` where `a` is the major release number, `b` is the minor release number, and `c` is the bug fix release number.

Odd minor release numbers are considered development releases leading up to the next even number. For example, `1.1.x` is a development release leading up to a stable `1.2.2` release.

Releases are also tagged with a status descriptor, which is one of:

* `alpha` - Incomplete or partially finished work.
* `beta` - Working but needs testing.
* `rc` - A release candidate, requesting further testing before calling it stable.
* `stable` - A release that is considered stable and well tested.

## Running Elefant's unit tests

Elefant uses [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/index.html) to run its test suite.

The database-bound tests use an in-memory SQLite database instead of mock objects.

The MongoModel tests require a locally running [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) instance, but will be skipped if the `mongo` PHP extension is not installed or a MongoDB connection cannot be established on `localhost:27017`.

To run an individual test, use:

	$ cd /path/to/your/site
	$ phpunit tests/CacheTest.php

To run the full suite of tests, use:

	$ cd /path/to/your/site
	$ phpunit tests
