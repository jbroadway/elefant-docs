# Translations

Here are the steps to translate Elefant into a new language and submit it for inclusion in the project:

1. Install a copy of Elefant from the [latest master branch on Github](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant).

2. Once you have Elefant installed, log in and go to Tools > Languages. It will first build an index of all the text in the default install, then present you with a list of languages. Click `Add language` to add a new one.

3. Enter the language name, code, etc. [See here for a list of language codes](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp). We recommend entering the language name in its own language, for example `Français` instead of `French` or `Español` instead of `Spanish`.

4. Once the language has been added, click `Edit` to edit its translations.

5. When you've finished your translation, find the translation file in the `lang` folder of your site. If you're comfortable using Github, you can submit your new translation through a Github pull request. Or you can paste the contents of the file into one of the following sites and then link to it in the [Elefant forum](/forum/) under the `I18n` category and someone will add it to the project for you.
