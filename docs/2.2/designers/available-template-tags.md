# Available template tags

When a layout template is run, it is passed the [Page](https://www.elefantcms.com/visor/lib/Page) object, which makes the following tags available to the template. Note the way each is used, as some have filters or conditions that will help ensure they render consistently.

### id

The page identifier, refers to the unique ID of the page used in the URL, e.g. in the page `http://www.example.com/page_id` the ID value would be `page_id`. If you need to include this in the template itself, use:

    {{ id }}

### title

The title of the page. This may be empty, so you can use a condition to only output the title if it's available:

    {% if title %}<h1>{{ title|none }}</h1>{% end %}

### menu_title

The `menu_title` is an optional alternate title for the page that's intended for use in site navigation. If there's no separate `menu_title` value, then it will have the same value as `title`. Usage:

    {{ menu_title|none }}

### window_title

Like `menu_title`, the `window_title` is an optional alternate title for the page that's intended for use in the `<title></title>` tags. If there's no separate `window_title` value, then it will have the same value as `title`. Usage:

    <title>{{ window_title|none }}</title>

You can also grab the site name from the global configurations and include it in the window title like this:

    <title>{{ conf('General', 'site_name') }} - {{ window_title|none }}</title>

### head

`head` is a special variable that holds any extra tags that handlers may want added to the `<head>` of the html output. To include it, you need to disable the default output filtering however, since otherwise it will convert HTML symbols like `<` into `&lt;` which in this case you don't want.

To use this, place it somewhere in your `<head></head>` tags, usually just before the closing tag.

    {{ head|none }}

> Note: The `|none` disables the default filter.

### tail

Similar to `head`, `tail` holds any extra tags that handlers may want to add just before the `</body>` closing tag, such as scripts that need to load asynchronously to not block your page rendering. To use this, place it just before your `</body>` tag like this:

    {{ tail|none }}

Note that `tail` is not a footer, it is appended after all your footer HTML has been rendered, so we named it to make that distinction clear.

### body

The `body` property contains the main body output for the page. To use it, you also need to disable the default output filter, like this:

    {{ body|none }}

Note that wherever the page body is in the template, at the top of it is where the Elefant page editing buttons will appear in the template.

## Including the admin toolbar

There is one special tag you need to include between your `<head></head>` tags that allows the Elefant CMS toolbar to appear:

    {! admin/head !}

This also includes jQuery into your `<head></head>`, which is used by several built-in handlers. This tag is the same as including the following PHP code:

	<?php echo $this->controller->run ('admin/head'); ?>
